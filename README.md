# Linear_regression_and_feature_selection

Feature Selection is one of the core concepts in machine learning which hugely impacts the performance of model. The data features that are used to train machine learning models have a huge influence on the performance of model. Irrelevant or partially relevant features can negatively impact model performance. The benefits of performing feature selection includes:

* Reduces Overfitting: Less redundant data means less opportunity to make decisions based on noise.
* Improves Accuracy: Less misleading data means modeling accuracy improves.
* Reduces Training Time: fewer data points reduce algorithm complexity and algorithms train faster.

This project will show how to do feature selection with the diabetes dataset. You will also see cross-validation and regularization methods used to reduce overfitting.
